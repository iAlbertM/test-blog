                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I must say it is a very difficult thing to learn a new language every month in school. Having to learn every grammatical rule, nuance, structure, and the features that come along with each web language and how they fit together with the rest of the web languages... that is just the icing on the cake, the easy part. I never thought I could make it with creating several web projects in 1 week for 8 weeks without a break, but I did. In the end, you look back and realize just how much you can endure.</p>
                    <p>Then you do the unthinkable... you choose to do it for fun. The thrill of it all excites you and makes you feel whole. My name is Albert Martinez and I am a web developer. Proud to be happy taking classes after school, keeping up with the web languages, looking forward to my first conference in a year or so. Trust me if I can do this, anyone can. Trust your crazy impulses and go for it, it is totally worth every hour I lost of sleep dedicating it to my work. There is so much good to come from self-motivation and determination. You have to do it for yourself and nothing or anyone else. Be happy and follow your heart. See you out in the World Wide Web.</p>
