                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I must say it is a very difficult thing to learn a new web language every month in school. Having to learn every grammatical rule, nuance, proper structure, and features with each web language incuding how they work together with the rest of the other web languages... that is just the icing on the cake, the easy part. I never thought I could make it with creating several web projects in 1 week for 8 weeks without a break, but I did for <em>2 years</em>! In the end, you look back and realize just how much you can do.</p>
                    <p>Then you do the unthinkable... you choose to do it for fun. The thrill of it all excites you and makes you feel whole. My name is <strong>Albert Martinez</strong> and I am a <em>web developer</em>. Proud to be taking classes after school's all done with, to keep up with the developing web languages, looking forward to my <em>first developer's conference</em> in a year or so. Trust me if I can do this, anyone can. Trust your crazy impulses and go for it, it is totally worth every hour I lost dedicating it to my work. There is so much good to come from self-motivation and determination. You have to do it for yourself and nothing or anyone else. Be happy and follow your heart. <strong>Send me a message if you ever need some help or get stuck and need a helping hand.</strong> Good Luck &amp; See you out in the World Wide Web.</p>
