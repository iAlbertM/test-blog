                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I must say it is a very challenging thing to become a web developer. Although fun, learning a new web language every month in school, having to learn every grammatical rule, nuance, syntax, structure, and web features for each was definitely enough to send anyone running for the hills. I never thought I could make it with several projects due weekly (aside from Midterms and Finals every month. YIKES!), all of course with little to no break. The schools adopted motto is "You can sleep when you graduate."  I wish I could say that was an exxaggeration. The thrill of it all excites you and makes you feel unstoppable. I did it though... for <em>2 years</em>! In the end, you look back and realize just how much you can really accomplish.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then you do the unthinkable... you choose to do it for fun (even worse... for free--at first). <br> Hello World! My name is <strong>Albert Martinez</strong> and I am a <em>web developer</em>. Proud to be taking classes after school's over and done with, just to keep up with the speed of technological advancements. There is so much good to come from self-discipline and determination. You have to do it <strong>for</strong> yourself but that doesn't mean you have to do it <strong>by</strong> yourself. Be happy knowing the developer community is a crowd of wonderful and very helpful people, but you have to ask, nicely. Do you and follow your heart. if you have questions, get stuck, and/or need a point in the right direction: <strong><a href="mailto:albertwdd@gmail.com">Send me a message</a>. I'll respond as quickly as I can.  Good Luck &amp; see you out in the World Wide Web.</p>
